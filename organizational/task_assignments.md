# Task assignments
- Requirements:
  - Extract requirements from documents  
    - Battery Passport  
    - DID  
    - VCs  
    - Brief overview of W3Cs  
  - Set/mark prioritization accordingly  
  - Derive role concept from documents (legal definitions, etc.; technical aspects differ or emerge from the architecture)  
  - Documentation: what exactly should be documented? (including for evaluation, since there isn’t a large volume of code)  
  - Create issues based on the defined requirements  
  - Keep the big picture in mind with sub-issues (developers create sub-issues; we create the main issues)  
  - Final report: we develop and explain the requirements → developers then detail the concrete implementation  
  - Determine what to include in the issues; must be clarified by next week  
  - Coordinate with the organizing team (Berkan, Pascal)  

- Infrastructure:
  - Import & adapt ADP (guidelines)  
  - GitHub configurations (repos, teams, branches, wiki, Kanban board, etc.)  
  - Coordination  
  - Technical infrastructure (containers)  
  - MIT license

  - Blockchain Core  
    - Storage  
    - Block structure  
    - Transaction structure  
    - Consensus algorithm (placeholder + approach in the docs)  
    - Peer-to-peer (placeholder + approach in the docs)  
  - Web API:  
    - GET /blocks  
    - GET /block/"b-id"  
    - POST /did  
    - PUT /did  
    - PUT /grant  
    - PUT /revoke  
    - GET /transaction/"t-id"  
    - GET /grants/"did"  
  - Block Explorer (frontend to view blocks and relationships)  
    - Read block  
    - DID relationships

- BMS: (https://md.s0ck.de/BMS)  
  - BMS-blockchain communication  
  - Collect battery data  
  - Encrypt battery data and send to the cloud  
  - Security (e.g., handling of the secret key)  
  - Hardware simulator  
  - (Infotainment system?)  
  - See https://md.s0ck.de/BMS  

- Client / Cloud:
  - API for battery data from the BMS  
  - Decrypt data with own private key  
  - Design database for the battery passport (tables and choice of database)  
  - Create own DID  
  - Create and update the battery passport  
  - Interface for the battery passport  
  - //Interface section:  
    - Document the interface between BMS and cloud  
    - Describe API endpoints with request/response examples  
    - Illustrate data flow between BMS, cloud, and battery passport  
    - Define requirements for data formats, authentication, and error handling
