# Process/Protocol 09.04.2025

- Details regarding assessment: see script on Moodle
  - Citing in final report:
    - Keep citations minimal → e.g., taken from the EU regulation (perhaps better placed in the introduction)

## Agenda

### Open Topics
- Define concrete tasks
- Specify the architecture
- Which assumptions can we make?
- Organization
- Test environment
- First steps of the individual teams
- Scope
- Rough structure of individual services

### Language/License/Documentation
- In which language do we want to work?
  - Final report?
  - GitHub?
  - Wiki?
- License: MIT License / Apache License 2.0 / BSD 3-Clause
- Documentation: Full documentation on GitHub, only notes in HedgeDoc
- Final report: Everyone writes individually first, and at the end, all parts are compiled together

- What exactly do we need to document on GitHub?
  - Code documentation is clear, but:
    - Notes?
    - Diagrams?
    - Text excerpts from documentation/standards that define requirements?
    - Descriptions of functionality?
    - Personal notes that lead to the result? 
      (Otherwise, only the final result, e.g., a completed requirement, can be evaluated, but not the path/work leading to it)

### Architecture
- Jonas' idea

### Task Definition
