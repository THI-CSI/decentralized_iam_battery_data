# Process/Protocol 16.04.2025

## Agenda

### 1) Open Topics
- GitHub username has been changed
- Code documentation: What should documentation look like?

### 2) Exchange on Approach with Team Presentations

#### a) Infrastructure/Organization

#### b) Requirements
Suggested approach:
1. Use predefined requirements as guidance
    - 20+ requirements have already been added on GitHub
2. Subissues can be organized under them:
    - Developers can start working
    - Requirements Engineering can work in parallel to sort and refine the requirements step-by-step and adjust the issue hierarchy if necessary
    - How subissues are defined: see Berkan's plan
3. Open questions:
    - For example, must the following be implemented?
        - Regulation, Chapter 9, Art. 77, (8):
          (8) The battery passport shall be deleted once the battery has been recycled.
            -> Our responsibility? Where does our work end?
        - Regulation, Chapter 9, Art. 77, (7):
          (7) For batteries prepared for reuse, repurposing, or remanufacturing, the responsibility for meeting the requirements under paragraph 4 of this Article shall be transferred to the economic operator who places the battery on the market or puts it into service. These batteries must have a new battery passport linked to the original battery passport(s).
            -> Architecture? Impact?
        - Regulation, Chapter 9, Art. 77, (4):
          (4) The economic operator placing the battery on the market ensures that the information contained in the battery passport is accurate, complete, and up-to-date. They may authorize other actors in writing to act on their behalf.
            -> Architecture? Impact?
        - Regulation, Chapter 9, Art. 78, c):
          (c) The data contained in the battery passport shall be stored by the economic operator responsible for fulfilling the requirements under Article 77(4) and (7), or by the actors authorized to act on their behalf;
            -> Considered in architecture?
        - (e) The battery passport shall remain available even if the responsible economic operator ceases to exist or stops operating in the Union.

4. Difficulties
    - Questions (see above): Which (technical) requirements are actually relevant for us?

#### c) Blockchain
- Dependencies: Socket API must be defined for the BMS #todo
- Definition of (at least 3) roles:
    - Authority (read) – Always receives data (mandatory)
    - Data Broker (read) – May receive certain data (must be authorized via a Grant Request)
    - BMS (write) – Collects data and sends it to the Data Broker

#### d) General
- QR Code
    - Responsibility: ???
    - Process: ?
    - 1. Link to cloud environment with public key of the BMS
    - 2. Cloud verifies public key
    - 3. Cloud returns the battery passport
- Common Docker setup?

#### e) BMS
- Building and flashing own firmware already works
    - Unix Makefile exists for both build and flash
    - Dependencies:
        - Building: ARM toolchain (e.g., arm-none-eabi-gcc)
        - Flashing: CLI tool (must be downloaded from the vendor's website)
    - Should Docker images be created for the build process?
- Emulation also theoretically possible
- Waiting for requirements

#### f) (placeholder)

#### g) Cloud
- Database for battery passports: GitHub repo with BatteryPassDataModel https://github.com/batterypass/BatteryPassDataModel
- Access via API (FastAPI with Python)
- POST: Accept data from BMS with validation using Verifiable Credentials (VCs)
    - Hybrid encryption (Which keys? RSA / ECC / [...]), insert or update
- GET: Access to battery passports (VCs)
- DELETE: Deleting the battery passport at the end of the battery’s life cycle (?)

- Key Management:
    - Generation of key pairs
    - Publication via Blockchain
- Interface for viewing the data: Different roles, VCs

##### First Cloud Issues:
- Python Flask Webserver
- SQLite database
- FastAPI API: Implement simple GET, POST, and DELETE requests → Protected API, Authorization
- Key generation (encryption algorithm)
- Interface for the data

### 3) Presentation of the Agile Working Method

### 4) To Do
- Prioritization
- Create labels for Requirements/Technology: Berkan/Pascal
- Estimate time effort
