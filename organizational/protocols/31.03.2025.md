# Process/Protocol 31.03.2025

## Agenda

### Way of Working
- **Tools**: GitHub, Hedgedoc for short-term documentation
- **IDs** could also be linked with architecture and requirements
- **ADP Guideline?**
- **Documentation**: Should we document everything directly in one repository?
- **Code-specific** documentation in the repository
- **Markdown** for writing texts
- **Gitplain**: shows who made which commits
- **Long-term documentation**: possibly GitHub or a Wiki later
- **Agile approach**: Mix of SCRUM and KANBAN
  - 1-week sprints
  - Weekly meeting: 
    - What did we accomplish?
    - Where are we stuck?
    - Noticed errors/issues
  - Artifacts:
    - Sprint Backlog
    - Product Backlog
    - "To Specify" → "Specified" (Sprint Backlog)
    - Step-by-step refinement of requirements in issues
    - Effort estimation currently difficult
    - Difference between fully elaborated and not-yet-elaborated tasks
  - **Iterative and incremental** working style
  - **Effort estimation** hopefully possible soon
  - **Regular prototypes** will be neglected
  - **Vertical or horizontal development?**
    - Probably somewhere in between
    - Requirements will become clearer over time
  - **Conclusion**:
    - Iterative and incremental
    - Weekly sprints
    - Between vertical and horizontal structure
    - No focus on prototypes
  - **Issue template** as a basis? 
    - Yet to be determined
    - Guidelines still pending
  - **Code reviews**: No direct push into the main repository
  - **GitHub collaboration**: Still needs to be clarified

### Architecture
- Manufacturer information is **not really confidential**
- Battery design **is more confidential**
- **Entities**:
  - BMS
  - Cloud
  - Web Application
  - IAM Blockchain
  - Users
  - Identity Blockchain
- "It’s not the idea that the battery passport runs on the BMS" – *Blümke*
- **Decentralized identities**
- **Concept**: Berkan/Jonas
- "Uploading data from the BMS might be easier to secure" – *Blümke*
- **Final decision/specification postponed**
